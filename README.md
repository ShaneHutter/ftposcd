This software connects to the Fishman Triple Play USB MIDI receiver and converts the MIDI data into Open Sound Control data, which is then sent to a designated host.  This software will also recieve certain OSC messages, convert the message into MIDI data, and send it into the Fishman Triple Play allowing for some control of the device.
